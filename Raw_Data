**This is a file designed purely to hold calculations and data before implementing them into code. Due to the messy nature of math in ASCII,
please keep all calculations on their own line, with double spaces.**

#Data **This is where miscellaneous data, such as masses and other constants, are kept for reference. Also, any final values from
calculations can be kept here.**



#Calculations **This is where any calculations should be put. Even if the calculation is already coded, it doesn't hurt to keep track of
them here as well.**
